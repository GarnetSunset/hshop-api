# hshop-api
Python API for interacting with the [hShop](https://hshop.erista.me).
# Usage
This project still has a long way to go, but here's what you can do right now and an example:

### Download content
```py
import hshop-api as hs
hs.download(478, r"C:\Users\Alexander\Desktop\CIAs\\") # Download Mario Kart 7 (Legit CIA), and send the path where it's going to be located to the API. NB: you might have to put in 2 backslashes to escape the blackslash and maybe throw in an r at the beginning of the path string. It is how it is.
```

Please don't donate to me if you liked this project, donate to hShop instead.
