# Usage
This project still has a long way to go, but here's what you can do right now and an example:

### Download content
```py
import hshop-api as hs
hs.download(478, r"C:\\Users\\Alexander\\Desktop\\CIAs\\") # Download Mario Kart 7 (Legit CIA), and send the path where it's going to be located to the API. NB: If you're on Windows, you have to put in 2 backslashes to escape the backslash and put an r before you begin the path string. This does not affect Linux or macOS.)
```

Also includes a tkinter GUI accessible by running the command "hshop-api"
